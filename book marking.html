            <p>Furniture, fixtures, and equipment (or FF&E) (sometimes Furniture,
                 furnishings, and equipment) is an accounting term used in valuing, 
                 selling, or liquidating a company or a building. FF&E are movable 
                 furniture, fixtures, or other equipment that have no permanent

            <p>Types of wood commonly used in furniture
Wood can be broadly categorized into hardwoods and softwoods, and further categorized into engineered wood: 
Hardwood: Derived from deciduous trees (those that shed leaves seasonally, like oak, maple, walnut). These woods are generally denser, stronger, and more durable, making them ideal for high-traffic areas or long-lasting furniture. Examples include oak, maple, cherry, walnut, mahogany, teak, sheesham (Indian rosewood), acacia, sal wood, mulberry, and satinwood.
Softwood: Obtained from coniferous trees (evergreens with needle-like leaves, such as pine, cedar, fir, redwood). Softwoods grow faster and are typically lighter and more affordable than hardwoods. They are suitable for various furniture pieces and often used in construction. Examples include pine, cedar, redwood, and deodar.
Engineered Wood: These are wood products manufactured by binding wood fibers or veneers together, forming composite materials like plywood, MDF (medium-density fiberboard), and particleboard. They offer an affordable alternative to solid wood, are stable and resist warping, making them suitable for areas with high moisture, and come in versatile finishes mimicking natural woods. </p>
